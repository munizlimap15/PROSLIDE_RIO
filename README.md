The RioSLIDE project focuses on analyzing and predicting landslides for the Rio de Janeiro municipality. Utilizing advanced geospatial data and predictive modeling techniques, the project aims to identify areas with high landslide susceptibility. The primary goal is to provide actionable insights to mitigate threats associated with landslides, especially during extreme weather conditions.

**Project Overview**

The initiative builds on previous models and incorporates historical data analysis to improve the accuracy of landslide predictions. By using modern data analytics, RioSLIDE aims to offer stakeholders informed decisions, ensuring the safety and resilience of communities in vulnerable areas.

**Key Features**

- 🌧️ **Exporting Susceptibility Predictions**: Seamlessly integrates susceptibility data into Shiny applications for enhanced visualization.  
- 📊 **Automated Data Extraction**: Streamlines the management of rainfall data from multiple sources, saving valuable time.  
- 🗺️ **Interactive Visualization**: Offers an engaging mapping interface for exploring landslide susceptibility in real-time.  
- 📈 **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: Analyzes complex spatial relationships, simplifying the understanding of landslide risks.  
- 🖥️ **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Shiny, enabling easy interaction with data for users of all technical levels.  
- 🔍 **Integration with Advanced Models**: Implements Generalized Additive Models (GAM) for precise predictions of landslide occurrences.

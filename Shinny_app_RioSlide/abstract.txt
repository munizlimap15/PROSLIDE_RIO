Landslides, while a natural element of landscape evolution, pose a substantial threat to infrastructure, property, and human life globally. This issue has escalated into a major public concern in Brazil over recent decades, particularly in the country's humid regions. The increasing frequency and catastrophic nature of landslides are exacerbated by poorly regulated living conditions and the ongoing impacts of climate and environmental change, which are expected to increase the frequency, magnitude, and resultant damage of these events. Despite efforts by local authorities to forecast and mitigate these phenomena, there remains a considerable gap in research aimed at prevention and preparedness for future events. In this context, the municipality of Rio de Janeiro stands as a critical case study. The city is highly susceptible to landslides due to complex geomorphological and climatic settings. According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, Rio de Janeiro, covering an area of approximately 1,200 km2, has a population of around 6.2 million, of which 22,7% reside in favelas. These communities, often situated on precarious hillslopes, face many challenges, including inadequate infrastructure, lack of sanitation, and high crime rates, which may diminish awareness of the threat posed by landslides. Rio de Janeiro lacks the availability of a representative digital landslide inventory. In aiming to close this gap, a landslide inventory was compiled by digitizing 2,988 geotechnical report-related occurrences from 2010 to 2016. This labor-intensive process identified 1,663 instances as shallow landslides out of the 2,988 reports. The dataset includes the location, typology, and a rich set of attributes such as date and time of occurrence (not necessarily available to all of them), land cover, and specific geometric parameters like length, steepness, width, and approximated volume. Initial temporal analysis revealed two key patterns: first, the year 2010 had a significant concentration of landslides; second, across the entire period from 2010 to 2016, a higher frequency of landslides was observed in the months of April and December, aligning with Rio de Janeiro's rainy season. When juxtaposed to the official Rio de Janeiro's existing landslide susceptibility map (https://www.data.rio/apps/PCRJ::suscetibilidade-a-deslizamentos/explore) , it is observed that 68% of the landslides occurred in low and medium-susceptibility zones, while only 32% occurred in high-susceptibility areas. This misalignment indicates that there is room for improvement in the existing map, which could be addressed by employing a data-driven approach to create an updated version of the landslide susceptibility map. The digitalization and availability of this comprehensive inventory is an essential step for developing an updated landslide susceptibility map using advanced data-driven models. A noteworthy observation from the inventory is the spatial distribution of landslides and other geotechnical occurrences concerning vulnerable communities, specifically favelas, which cover only 4% of Rio de Janeiro's territory. Despite their limited geographical extent, favelas were the location for 58% of the geotechnical occurrences and 35% of the actual landslides. This disproportionate occurrence underscores the critical need for targeted susceptibility assessments and interventions, particularly in these high-vulnerable areas. A set of eleven relevant landslide predictors was also obtained to characterize better the landslide occurrence over the topographic and environmental variables. These predictors include a digital terrain model (DTM) with a 5 m resolution (originally resampled from a LiDAR survey), and other DTM derivatives such as aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, relative slope position, slope, topographic wetness index (TWI), topographic position index (TPI). Thematic maps like land cover map (from 2019), geomorphological and geological maps were also used. These variables were rigorously tested for their contribution in predicting landslide occurrences using metrics like AUC and AIC. Based on these initial investigations, specific predictors like plan curvature, relative position index, and topographic wetness and position indices (TWI and TPI) showed low significance in predicting landslide locations. In contrast, others were relatively more important in explaining the landslide occurrences. The newly digitized landslide inventory provides a robust foundation for developing an updated, data-driven susceptibility map for Rio de Janeiro. However, for the data-driven spatial landslide prediction, prediction, the inventory bias related to the report-related observations which caused damage in houses and infrastructure has to be dealt with, possibly by the application of mixed-effects models. This new model has the potential to enhance the existing official susceptibility map, thereby better preparing communities and infrastructure for future landslide events. Preliminary results indicate room for improvement in the current map, as a significant number of landslides occurred in areas classified as having low to medium susceptibility. This inventory is not only a vital tool for immediate preparedness and management but also sets the stage for future research aimed at refining modeling techniques, leveraging the inventory's strengths and addressing its limitations.
